# ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md — How DalyHub Fits Together

> The technical map of the system: how the kernel, modules, data, and platform fit together. Where [`ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md) explains *why*, this document explains *how the pieces relate*.
>
> **Status of this document.** DalyHub V2 is a redevelopment; some of what's described here is the *intended* target realised progressively through the [Foundation phase of `ROADMAP_V2.md`](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#phase-0--foundation-fnd). Where a choice is a proposed direction rather than settled fact, it is flagged. Treat specific technology names as the current recommendation, revisable via a new ADR — the *shape* (small kernel, modular userland) is the settled part.

**Reading the stack:** dependencies point downward. Modules depend on the Design System and Kernel; the Kernel depends only on the Platform. Nothing lower reaches up; modules never reach sideways into each other — they compose through kernel contracts and the module registry. This is the "small kernel, modular userland" principle from [`AGENTS.md §9.1`](../../AGENTS.md#91-small-kernel-modular-userland).

---

## The kernel

The kernel is deliberately small and rarely changes. Each concept below maps to an ADR and a Foundation roadmap item.

| Kernel concept | What it provides | ADR | Roadmap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Entities** | Uniform record substrate (id, type, workspace, timestamps, soft-delete) | [ADR-001](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-001-area-hierarchy) | [FND-02](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-02--data-kernel-entities--storage) |
| **Workspaces** | Top-level isolation & security boundary | [ADR-003](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-003-workspace-isolation) | [FND-03](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-03--workspace-isolation) |
| **EntityLinks** | Typed, bidirectional links between any entities | [ADR-002](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-002-entitylinks) | [FND-04](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-04--entitylinks) |
| **Activity** | Append-only uniform event stream | [ADR-005](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-005-shared-activity-model) | [FND-05](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-05--shared-activity-model) |
| **Module Registry** | Self-registration of modules' capabilities | [ADR-007](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-007-module-registry) | [FND-06](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-06--module-registry) |
| **Area spine** | Area→Goal→Project→Task + rollup | [ADR-001](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-001-area-hierarchy) | [FND-07](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-07--area--goal--project--task-hierarchy) |
| **Markdown pipeline** | One authoring/storage/sanitising renderer | [ADR-006](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-006-markdown-strategy) | [FND-08](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-fnd-08--markdown-pipeline) |
| **AI proposals** | Propose→review→apply engine | [ADR-004](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-004-ai-proposal-architecture) | [AI-01](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#phase-11--ai-ai) |

### The entity model in one picture

```
Workspace
  └── Area (permanent)
        ├── Goal (optional outcome)
        │     └── Project ── Task
        └── Project ── Task           (project may sit directly under an Area)

Any entity ──EntityLink──> any entity     (Notes, Meetings, People, Assets, Diary attach via links)
Any mutation ──appends──> Activity         (rendered as Timeline / Activity Feed)
```

Supporting entities (Note, Meeting, Person, Asset, Diary, Review) are full entities that connect to the spine through **EntityLinks** rather than being children of it. This keeps the spine clean while letting everything relate to everything (see [`PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md`](../product/PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md#how-these-fit-together-the-shape-of-a-day)).

---

## Modules (userland)

A module is a self-contained feature area (Today, Projects, Notes, …). Each one, via the [Module Registry](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-007-module-registry), declares:

- **Routes** — the surfaces it owns in the shell.
- **Entity types** — the records it manages (built on the kernel entity substrate).
- **Commands** — actions exposed to the [Command Palette](../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md#command-palette).
- **Search providers** — how its records appear in [global Search](../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md#search).
- **Settings** — its configuration, rendered through the shared [Settings](../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md#settings) pattern.

**Module rules:**
- A module never imports another module's internals. Cross-module relationships go through **EntityLinks**.
- A module builds its UI from the **shared Design System** — no bespoke duplicates ([`AGENTS.md §9.8`](../../AGENTS.md#98-shared-over-bespoke)).
- A module is independently implementable, matching the [ROADMAP](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md) structure — one item, one PR.

---

## Shared Design System layer

The Design System sits between modules and the kernel: reusable, kernel-aware UI (a Card knows how to render any entity; the Drawer opens any record; Timeline renders the Activity model). Its patterns and rules are specified in [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) and built in [ROADMAP Phase 1 (`DS-*`)](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#phase-1--shared-design-system-ds). Modules consume it; they do not fork it.

---

## Platform (proposed direction)

> **Flagged as proposed.** These are the current recommended platform choices, informed by the tools already in the project's orbit (Cloudflare, plus Todoist/Notion as import sources). Confirm and record any change via a new ADR before relying on specifics.

- **Client:** a modern typed web stack (React + TypeScript recommended), Design System built on accessible primitives and utility styling. See [`OPEN_SOURCE_POLICY.md`](../governance/OPEN_SOURCE_POLICY.md) and [`REFERENCE_PRODUCTS.md`](../reference/REFERENCE_PRODUCTS.md) for candidate libraries (command palette, editor, drag-and-drop, dates).
- **Edge/runtime & storage:** Cloudflare Developer Platform — Workers for compute, D1 (SQLite) for relational entity/link/activity data, KV for fast config/cache, R2 for [Asset](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#phase-8--assets-asset) files, Durable Objects where strong coordination is needed.
- **Markdown & editor:** a Markdown-native editor feeding the shared sanitising renderer ([ADR-006](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-006-markdown-strategy)).
- **Auth:** single-user first (the owner), designed so multi-user isn't precluded; workspace scoping already provides the isolation seam.
- **Background work:** for reminders (renewals, stay-in-touch), review cadences, and import/sync — scheduled/queued jobs on the platform.
- **External integrations:** Todoist, Notion, and calendars as **import/sync sources** ([X-03](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-x-03--import--sync-todoist-notion-calendar)); imported data is untrusted until validated ([security](../../AGENTS.md#17-security-requirements)).

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

- **Security & privacy.** Workspace scoping is enforced server-side on every request; sensitive entities (People, Diary) are excluded from external/AI context without per-action opt-in. See [`AGENTS.md §17`](../../AGENTS.md#17-security-requirements) and [ADR-004](../decisions/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#adr-004-ai-proposal-architecture).
- **Performance.** Virtualise Activity/Timeline/search; optimistic UI for mutations; lean payloads and lazy-loaded modules. Budgets in [`AGENTS.md §16`](../../AGENTS.md#16-performance-expectations).
- **Data portability & backup.** Markdown + structured export ([X-04](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-x-04--export--data-portability)) and tested backup/restore ([SET-02](../roadmap/ROADMAP_V2.md#-set-02--backup--restore)) — the system is the user's memory and must be recoverable.
- **Observability.** The Activity model provides a functional/audit history; operational logging must never contain sensitive entity content.

## Where to make changes

| If you're changing… | Do this |
|---|---|
| A kernel contract or core concept | Write a new **ADR**, then implement; expect broad impact. |
| A shared UI pattern | Update [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) and the shared component in the same PR. |
| One module's behaviour | Stay within the module; relate to others via EntityLinks only. |
| A platform/technology choice | New **ADR** documenting the change and its consequences. |
